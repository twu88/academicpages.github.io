excerpt: 'As IoT devices become more incorporated into our daily lives, their always on approach makes them an ideal source of evidence. While these devices should use encryption to protect sensitive information, in reality this is not always the case e.g. some expose sensitive data like credentials in cleartext. In this paper, we have conducted an extensive analysis on the communications channels of 32 IoT consumer devices. Our experiments consisted of four main parts; first we carried out a port scan to determine if any ports can be exploited and thus gain remote access. Second, we looked at whether any of the devices used encryption and if not what type of content was exposed. Third, we used the network traffic ‘metadata’ to identify the destination the data terminated. Finally, we examined the communication between the mobile app and the cloud to see if it can be easily exploited using a proxy server. Our findings …'
